# The hermes database project

## Why does this exist?
This repository will hold SQL files that handle the data management for the hermes project database<br>

See [hermes project](https://github.com/cybercritter/hermes) for more information.

While these sql files are not strictly necessary, it will help someone who wants to maintian<br>
their own database by creating the tables and associated relationships.

Thanks.
